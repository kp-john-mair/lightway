# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I need to sign a CLA before contributing to Lightway Core?
The reason we have a CLA is to be upfront and transparent about what happens when someone contributes code to the project. It is important to note that the author maintains ownership of the code at all times and that we will immediately release any contributions under the GPL 2.0 license. This helps to protect the project by ensuring that any code in the repository can be released under the GPL 2.0 license both now and in the future. This is why the Apache Foundation requires a CLA for all contributions—the intent is to protect everyone's interests.

As part of any code contribution, we will list the author's name and what was contributed so that the author will get full recognition for their work.

## Which TLS library does Lightway use?

Lightway uses wolfSSL by default, and it remains the main, recommended TLS
backend. BoringSSL is now also supported as an alternative backend, selected
at compile time via cargo features (the two are mutually exclusive). See
[TLS backends](./tls_backends.md) for how to enable each one.

## Does Lightway client/server applications support IPv6 ?

Lightway apps does not currently provide full IPv6 support on either the client or server.

 - IPv6 traffic is not carried by the tunnel
 - On desktop, in route modes `default` and `lan`, the client routes all IPv6
   traffic into a blackhole (the loopback interface on macOS and Linux, the
   tunnel interface on Windows) where it is discarded, so IPv6 (including DNS
   queries to IPv6 resolvers) cannot bypass the tunnel. This is controlled by
   `block_ipv6`, which is on by default; in `lan` mode unique local addresses
   (`fc00::/7`) keep following the existing IPv6 default route. Link-local and
   multicast traffic stays on its on-link routes. A host with no IPv6 stack
   has nothing to discard and skips these routes.
 - Without `block_ipv6` (or in route mode `noexec`, or on mobile) IPv6
   firewalling and leak prevention are not handled by Lightway
 - Rate limiting is out of scope for the Lightway client at this time

Full IPv6 support for both the Lightway client and server is planned for a future release.
Until then, Lightway should be considered IPv4-focused, and deployments should be configured accordingly.

## Firewall Configuration

The Lightway client does not configure or manage firewall rules.
If you are using the Lightway client, you are responsible for ensuring that appropriate firewall rules are in place, including (but not limited to):

 - Applying any required rate limiting
 - Blocking or restricting IPv6 traffic
 - Preventing IPv6 traffic from bypassing the tunnel where `block_ipv6` does
   not apply (route mode `noexec`, `block_ipv6: false`, or mobile)

Without proper firewall configuration, traffic may bypass the tunnel depending on system and network settings.
